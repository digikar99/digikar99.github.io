I sometimes wish to write on topics that I'm just familiar with. But as soon as I sit down to write, I realize that while I may have spent a few days reading about a topic, there are others who spend their entire careers reading and learning about them. Simply sharing any interesting articles I come across seems to have a much higher utility for everyone involved. Below, I am maintaining such a list.

Some of my Quora answers have been collected [[https://human9being9.wordpress.com/my-quora/][here]]. Most of them were written around 2014, before the decline of the platform began.

There's also a [[http://human9being9.wordpress.com/][wordpress]] blog I write on sometimes. Some articles of general interest might include:

Around the end of high school and the beginning of college, I used to wonder if anything could be done to make middle school education less siloed. I ended up with a partly-made (10%?) website - [[https://digikar99.github.io/alterschoolindia][alterschoolindia]] - that aimed at moving from one topic (eg: civics) to a distant another (eg: mathematics) through continuous interactive questioning.

- There's also a section on [[https://digikar99.github.io/alterschoolindia/intermediate.html][alterschoolindia/intermediate]]: Some resources on Career Tasting (yes, that's T-A-S-T) - It's less of "Let's see how you perform" and more of "Check for yourself how you like each of these".

- I recently ran into a [[https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xg3hXCYQPJkwHyik2/the-best-textbooks-on-every-subject][LessWrong Blog Post on The Best Textbooks on Every Subject]] that may be of use to some. 

Lacking an audience, and perhaps, more importantly, realizing that "useless" school education would be determined by the sociocultural system of a society, I lost the motivation for developing alterschoolindia further. It seems that to decide the school curriculum, one needs some opinions on the sociocultural system of a society -- hopefully, there exists something more sensible/efficient than the modern democratic systems. Here, by "useless", I mean the modern notion that school education should focus on "useful" skills and knowledge that can actually be applied so that the future citizens can be more productive members of the +labour-force+ society.
