** Who am I?


Uhm, well, I have elaborated it [[https://human9being9.wordpress.com/2020/05/03/me/][here]].

Go, have a read!

.

Waiting for you

.

Okay, on a serious note: as of January 2023, I've completed my undergraduate with a specialization in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Bombay, and am currently a second year masters student pursuing Cognitive Science at IIT Kanpur.

I'm currently working on Computational Cognitive Modeling of Multiple Object Tracking in Humans as part of my Masters' thesis under Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava, and am enjoying and exploring the motivations and implications of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenon_Pylyshyn][Pylyshyn]]'s [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_indexing_theory][Visual Indexing Theory]] while working out a model of multiple object tracking without indexes.

Someday I hope to explore the implications and limitations of Artificial General Intelligence from the perspective of Non-Axiomatic Reasoning and Replicode.
