I am a graduate student under the Cognitive Science department at IIT Kanpur, India. As part of my master's thesis, I investigated the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_indexing_theory][Visual Indexing Theory]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenon_Pylyshyn][Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn]]. I've worked on an index-less model of human multiple object tracking of visually identical objects under the guidance of [[https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/][Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava]].

I also have a background in computer science through an undergraduate degree at IIT Bombay, and spend my free time developing and maintaining [[file:common-lisp-and-emacs.html][Common Lisp libraries]].

In the longer run, I wish to build machines with human-like general learning abilities that require zero programmer maintenance. Over the years, I have developed [[file:thoughts.html][a few thoughts]] about this.
