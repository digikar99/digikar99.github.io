Hello, I am Shubhamkar Ayare. My work may be summarized in terms of two main spheres of life.

*Primary sphere of a graduate student.* Currently, I'm pursuing my PhD at the Central European University in Vienna, Austria. I am working under [[https://www.jfkominsky.com/index.html][Prof. Jonathan Kominsky]] as my primary supervisor as part of the [[https://ccl.ceu.edu][Causal Cognition Lab]]. I completed my Master's in Cognitive Science from IIT Kanpur under [[https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/][Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava]] as part of the [[https://www.cgs.iitk.ac.in/user/nsrivast/platipus-lab/][PLATIPUS Lab]]. 

I have very much enjoyed my interactions with [[https://sites.google.com/view/devpriya-kumar/home][Prof. Devpriya Kumar]] and will be forever grateful for the often lengthy (but very interesting!) discussions with [[https://sites.google.com/site/ammuns68][Prof. Narayanan Srinivasan]]. Unfortunately, I ran out of time at IIT Kanpur before I could interact more with others.

My primary sphere is largely driven by a quest to put the unknown unknowns relevant for building machines with human-like general intelligence into a more-or-less consistent framework. [[file:ai-cogsci.html][See what research areas this has touched so far.]]

I had previously attempted an online forum for cognitive science, but it has since been [[file:cogscilounge.html][archived]]. 

*Secondary sphere of a Common Lisp Enthusiast.* This mainly began around my undergraduate days in Computer Science at IIT Bombay. It has been motivated by a search for a powerful practical yet stable programming platform for long term projects. This sphere contributes to my primary sphere every now and then, but it may be understood independently. [[file:common-lisp-and-emacs.html][See what projects this sphere had led to.]]

Besides these two spheres of life, I keep reading and sharing links to interesting, useful, or silly articles I run into or, sometimes, write. Upon a friend's recommendation, I'm maintaining them [[file:miscellaneous.html][here]].
