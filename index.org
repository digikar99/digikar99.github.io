I am a graduate student under the Cognitive Science department at IIT Kanpur, India. As part of my master's thesis, I investigated the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_indexing_theory][Visual Indexing Theory]] of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenon_Pylyshyn][Dr. Zenon Pylyshyn]] (also see [[citet:&pylyshyn2007book]]). I've worked on an index-less model of human multiple object tracking of visually identical objects under the guidance of [[https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/nsrivast/][Prof. Nisheeth Srivastava]] [[cite:&ayare2023tracking]]

I did my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at IIT Bombay, where I had the chance to acquaintance myself with Reinforcement Learning and do a project on Tangram Solving using Constraint Satisfaction under [[https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~shivaram/][Prof. Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan]].

I spend my free time developing and maintaining Common Lisp libraries. These include a library to [[https://github.com/digikar99/py4cl2-cffi][call python callables from Common Lisp]] or a (very primitive) library for [[https://digikar99.github.io/numericals/][high performance numerical computing]] powered by [[https://github.com/digikar99/bmas][SIMD operations]]. Now, [[https://gist.github.com/digikar99/b76964faf17b3a86739c001dc1b14a39][Common Lisp has its limitations]], so while developing the numerical computing library, I have also gotten dragged into [[https://gitlab.com/digikar/peltadot/][extending Common Lisp's types and dispatching over them]].

My interest in Common Lisp has stemmed from a search for a stable platform for long term projects, potentially spanning decades. It is [[http://random-state.net/features-of-common-lisp.html][more flexible yet stable than Python]] and at least [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19877268/why-are-python-and-ruby-so-slow-while-lisp-implementations-are-fast][one of its implementations (SBCL) is an optimizing compiler]] generating native code as performant as C compilers. These days, there are various [[https://portability.cl/][defacto libraries]] providing support for a number of modern features including multithreading and unicode amongst others. There are also [[https://github.com/coalton-lang/coalton/][efforts to bring the goodness of Hindley-Milner type system to Common Lisp]].

I fancy the development of machines with human-like general intelligence. But after an initial encounter with artificial intelligence and machine learning, I have ended up on [[file:ai-cgs/20th-century.html][a tour to Dreyfus and Hiedeggerian AI]]. 

I now think research into causality cite:&gopnik2022causal and on enabling robots and machines to learn from their sociocultural environments cite:&colas2022language would be important precursors for general intelligence. Reinforcement learning with some augmentations cite:&colas2022autotelic looks like a useful framework for both these goals.
